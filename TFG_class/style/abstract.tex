\chapter*{Abstract}
This Master’s Thesis describes the design and development of the Learning Ecosystem, a web application aimed at improving the management of internal training at Tracasa Global and Tracasa Instrumental. The project arises from the need for a single platform that makes it easier to organize and manage all aspects related to employee training, from the initial request of a training activity to its final evaluation.

The application brings together key features in one environment, such as requesting new training activities, approval by managers and directors, and tracking the status of each process. In addition, it provides direct access to external learning and cybersecurity platforms, thereby expanding the professional development opportunities available to employees. It also includes tools that improve control and traceability, such as change history tracking, management of attendees and instructors, and the collection of feedback and effectiveness surveys.

Another key aspect of the project is the management of annual training plans. The application allows different departments to propose, review, and combine training activities, as well as to keep track of approved proposals and their relationship with the training sessions that are created. This functionality supports more strategic planning aligned with the organization’s overall needs.

Ultimately, this work represents a step forward in the digitalization of corporate training and reinforces the company’s commitment to continuous improvement, ongoing learning, and a more agile and transparent approach to talent management.
